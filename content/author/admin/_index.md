I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Polina Golland's lab](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/) at MIT, working on machine learning algorithms for healthcare applications. I currently develop generative models for natural images, Chest X-Rays and brain images, which can be used as prior models for image reconstruction tasks, using bayesian posterior optimisation.

During my PhD, I developed Bayesian statistical models for prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative diseases. Such models were able to not only to estimate the continuous evolution of Alzheimer's disease, but also discover novel spatial patterns of brain pathology (e.g. [DIVE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919301491)) or transfer such "learned evolutions" in populations with different diseases (e.g. [DKT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03517)). I further co-organised [TADPOLE](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org/), an international competition that compared 92 algorithms from 33 teams at predicting the evolution of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, together with UCL colleagues N. Firth and S. Primativo, I performed one of the first comprehensive clinical studies ([Firth et al., Brain, 2019](https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/142/7/2082/5521045)) on the evolution of Posterior Cortical Atrophy, a rare dementia affecting the visual system.

On the technical side, I particularly enjoy the mathematics of statistical inference methods for Machine Learning. For example, I derived the EM-update rules for two complex Bayesian models that I proposed (see Supplementary section of the [DIVE article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03553.pdf) and Appendix sections B and D of my [PhD thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.04805.pdf)).

I also have a keen interest in general machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to make computers perform intelligent tasks. Aside from research, at MIT I was also the president of the [Postdoctoral Association](https://pda.mit.edu/), working with the MIT administration to create a better research environment for postdocs.

My partner [Leilani Gilpin](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lgilpin/) is also a researcher in ML, and does fantastic work on ML Explainability using logical reasoning methods. See her publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UFT_ijYAAAAJ&hl=en).
