# Abstract.
abstract = "Music therapy has been shown in recent years to provide multiple health benefits related to emotional wellness. In turn, maintaining a healthy emotional state has proven to be effective for patients undergoing treatment, such as Parkinson's patients or patients suffering from stress and anxiety. We propose fine-tuning MusicGen, a music-generating transformer model, to create short musical clips that assist patients in transitioning from negative to desired emotional states. Using low-rank decomposition fine-tuning on the MTG-Jamendo Dataset with emotion tags, we generate 30-second clips that adhere to the iso principle, guiding patients through intermediate states in the valence-arousal circumplex. The generated music is evaluated using a music emotion recognition model to ensure alignment with intended emotions. By concatenating these clips, we produce a 15-minute *music medicine* resembling a music therapy session. Our approach is the first model to leverage Language Models to generate music medicine. Ultimately, the output is intended to be used as a temporary relief between music therapy sessions with a licensed therapist."
